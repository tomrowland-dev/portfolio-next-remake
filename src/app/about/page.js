                    <br />
                    I started coding in 2018, and ever since ive been working within various computing spaces.
                    <br />
                    Beginning with Python, Ive since become experienced in development with Javascript, and have worked with various frameworks and libraries, including React and NextJS (Just updated this site to use Next13, making use of the new App Router - routing is so much easier now!).
                    <br />
                    Beyond web development, Ive also worked with various other languages, including C#, C++, GO, and Rust.
                    <br />
                    Lately Ive been moving away from web development more towards C#, developing my Units 3/4 Software Development SAT for VCE using C# and AvaloniaUI. I also have been using C# to work on creating plugins for Rust (the game) using the Oxide modding framework.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I also have experience with various other technologies, including Docker, and various cloud providers such as AWS.
                    <br />
                    Through my learning in computing, Ive also become experienced in Linux, and have been using it as my daily driver in combination with Windows. I have experience with various other operating systems, including MacOS, and many linux distros.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Recently I have completed a Certificate III in Information Technology (Networking and Cybersecurity), and over the summer of 2023-2024 I am begining a Certificate IV in Information Technology and a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity.
                    With this experience in security, Ive come to a deep understanding on a low level of how computers work, and have been able to use this knowledge to my advantage in my development and in projects such as developing stealth virtual machines to bypass even the lowest level kernal based anti-cheats / anti-tamper such as EasyAntiCheat, BattleEye and Vangaurd.
                    <br />
                    This has also lead to developing a deep understanding of the WindowsAPI, and understanding Dynamic Link Libraries, how they work, and how to use them to my advantage through Process injection or Process Hyjacking.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am looking at working within the Software Development or Cybersecrity space within the next few years post highschool.
