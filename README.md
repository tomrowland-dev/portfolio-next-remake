## Portfolio website project 

This is a simple site put together with Next13 to host some simple about and contact information. 
It was updated from just using vanilla React to utilising Next as part of learning how to use it. 

This project was also an excersize in utilising github actions. With actions it means that when a new commit is made to the master src branch, the project is then recompiled to a build branch of the repo to eaily allow it to be hosted on Github Pages.
